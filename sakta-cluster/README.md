## Status

This module is WIP (or even pre-WIP).

Stuff **not** (yet) sorted out;
- How to (de-)serialise messages between members
- How to keep track of members
- How to keep track of actor ownership
- How to migrate actor state between owners
- How to gracefully join/leave the cluster
- Basically everything :)
